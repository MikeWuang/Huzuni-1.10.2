(This will be updated when the mod is completely updated)

You are free to use Huzuni source under the following conditions:
- Your project cannot be called Huzuni or any variation (e.g. Huzuni Reloaded, Huzuni2, Newzuni, etc.)
- Your project must be open-source
- You must give credit
- You cannot use the assets (textures) from the original repository.
- You cannot profit off of our code, unless given direct permission.

Again, these terms will be updated a bit when the mod is fully released.
